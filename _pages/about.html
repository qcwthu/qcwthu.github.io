        Hi! I'm Chengwei Qin, currently an Assistant Professor in <a href="https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/information-hub/artificial-intelligence" target="_blank">Thrust of Artificial Intelligence</a> at HKUST(GZ), 
        leading the HKUST(GZ) NLP group. I am also an Affiliated Assistant Professor at HKUST. I obtained my Ph.D. from the College of Computing and Data Science
        at <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg" target="_blank">Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU)</a>, advised by <a href="https://raihanjoty.github.io" target="_blank">Prof. Shafiq Joty</a> and <a href="https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/axsun/" target="_blank">Prof. Aixin Sun</a>. 
        Before that, I graduated from the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University, supervised by <a href="https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/" target="_blank">Prof. Zhiyuan Liu</a>.
